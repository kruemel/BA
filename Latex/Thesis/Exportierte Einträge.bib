	title = {An {Efficient} {Evolutionary} {Approach} to {Parameter} {Identification} in a {Building} {Thermal} {Model}},
	abstract = {Abstract—Thermal models of buildings are often used to identify energy savings within a building. Given that a significant proportion of that energy is typically used to maintain building temperature, establishing the optimal control of the buildings thermal system is important. This requires an understanding of the thermal dynamics of the building, which is often obtained from physical thermal models. However, these models require detailed building parameters to be specified and these can often be difficult to determine. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary approach to parameter identification for thermal models that are formulated as an optimization task. A state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm, i.e., SaNSDE+, has been developed. A fitness function is defined,},

	doi = {10.1109/AIM.2014.6878100},
	abstract = {We consider the problem of gray-box identification of dynamic models for mechanical systems. In particular, the problem is approached by means of continuous-time system identification using subspace-based methods based on discrete-time input-output data. A method is developed, with the property that the structure of the model resulting from fundamental physical first principles is obtained and the parameter matrices have a clear physical interpretation. The proposed method is subsequently successfully validated in both simulation and using experimental data from a three-axis manipulator. In both cases the identified models exhibit good fit to the input-output data. The results indicate that the proposed method can be useful in the context of model-based control design in, for example, impedance force control for robots and manipulators, but also for modal analysis of mechanical systems.},
